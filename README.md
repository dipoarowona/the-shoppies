# The Shoppies

- Created The Shoppies Application using ReactJS
- Allows user to search for movies, add them to a nominations list and also remove it from the nominations list
- Once you have more than 5 or more nominations you will recieve a notication
- Nominations are stored via local storage so therefore if you leave the page and return your nominations will be there ready for you
